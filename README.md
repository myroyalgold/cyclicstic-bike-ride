## Track A
### Case Study 1 Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

### Problem Statement: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

### Introduction 
As the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I'm tasked with analyzing a public dataset for Cyclistic, an imaginary bike-share company located in Chicago. Throughout this case study, I'll utilize the R programming language for data analysis and visualization.

### About the Company
<br> Cyclistic was launched in 2016 and has since expanded its program, boasting a fleet of 5,824 bicycles meticulously tracked through geotracking technology and securely stationed across a network of 692 locations throughout Chicago.
<br> Cyclistic distinguishes itself by providing a range of options beyond traditional bicycles, including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. This inclusive approach aims to cater to individuals with disabilities and those unable to use standard two-wheeled bikes, making bike-sharing accessible to a broader audience.
<br> The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes, but approximately 8% of riders use the assistive options.
<br> Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

### Cyclistic Marketing Strategy
<br> Historical perspective/Approach: Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
<br> Pricing plan: One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
<br> Customer categprization:
-  Casual Riders: Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
- Cyclistic Members: Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
<br> Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders.

### Marketing Team
<br> The director of marketing and manager: Lily Moreno is the director of marketing and manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels
